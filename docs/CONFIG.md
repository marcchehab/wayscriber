# Configuration Guide

## Overview

wayscriber supports customization through a TOML configuration file located at:
```
~/.config/wayscriber/config.toml
```

All settings are optional. If the configuration file doesn't exist or settings are missing, sensible defaults will be used.

### Configured defaults and runtime UI preferences

`config.toml` is the authored source for configured defaults. Some direct overlay customizations are
saved separately so moving through the UI does not rewrite unrelated configuration:

- top toolbar pin and minimized state (the toolbar show/hide keybinding updates the
  remembered pin, so the next start matches what was on screen; implicit hides —
  presenter mode, focus mode — remain run-only);
- the top strip's display form reached with the cycle keybinding or the micro chip;
- the top toolbar's dragged position;
- individual toolbar item visibility and toolbar item order;
- the toolbar layout preset and which named toolbar sections are shown;
- the toolbar's own appearance and behaviour toggles — icons vs text labels, extra colours,
  context-aware UI, preset toasts, idle fade, the tool preview, and the delay sliders;
- the status bar, whether its segments respond to clicks, and which segments are shown;
- the board and page badges, the floating badge, and the zoom chip;
- the click highlight and the ring the highlight tool keeps on screen;
- the input HUD and the history pane's custom-step section; and
- per-board pin state.

The generated file is `$XDG_DATA_HOME/wayscriber/runtime-ui.toml`, normally
`~/.local/share/wayscriber/runtime-ui.toml`. It is not a second configuration file and should not
be hand-edited. The configurator labels affected controls as configured defaults. On startup, and
after a same-process config/session reload, Wayscriber treats those configured values as seeds and
applies any retained runtime overrides on top. If a configured seed changes to match an override,
the redundant override is removed.

The current runtime-state format is version 1. Unknown fields in a supported version are preserved
across writes, including unknown fields attached to a retained override. A newer version is loaded
read-only and is never downgraded automatically. Resetting a newer or invalid file requires an
explicit confirmation; the exact source bytes are moved to a recovery artifact before the reset,
and the Settings panel shows the artifact's complete path.

Runtime-state writes are conditional on the exact inspected source and parent-directory identity.
Wayscriber does not overwrite an externally changed file, follow or replace the final path when it
is a symlink, or continue through a retargeted parent. If another writer wins, its freshly inspected
state becomes authoritative. Every accepted runtime preference change settles as persisted,
superseded by a reset, won by the external source, changed after a claimed write, or failed.

When persistence is uncertain, the Settings panel blocks further runtime preference mutations and
offers incident-scoped actions: retry the pending save, discard pending changes and use the current
disk state, or preserve an invalid file and reset after confirmation. Recovery can be cancelled
while it is read-only; if a write has already started, Wayscriber waits for its real completion
before reinspection. Diagnostic and recovery-artifact paths are shown without truncating their
contents.

If runtime-state inspection or its writer cannot start at all, the Settings panel reports
persistence as unavailable instead of offering recovery actions that cannot run. Runtime-only
toolbar and board changes remain process-only in that mode and leave the authored configuration
unchanged; a toolbar dragged or a display mode cycled in that mode applies for the current run and
returns to its configured default on the next start.

#### Only your explicit edits write the file

`config.toml` is an authored input. It changes only when you deliberately edit something, never as
a side effect of running Wayscriber. Exactly two kinds of action write it:

- **The configurator's Save**, which writes the whole draft you edited.
- **Three narrow overlay editors** — the shortcut editor, the preset slots, and the quick-color
  palette. Each writes only its own key: editing a shortcut rewrites that one action's
  `[keybindings]` entry, saving a preset rewrites that one `[presets.slot_N]` table, recoloring a
  swatch rewrites that one `[[drawing.quick_colors]]` entry. Everything else in the file — your
  comments, your section order, your other settings — is left byte-for-byte alone, and the previous
  contents are copied to a timestamped `.bak` first.

Those four actions — a Save and the three editors — are the only ones. Startup, shutdown, the
daemon, the tray, validation, and the migration preview read and interpret the file and never
create, replace, rewrite, touch, chmod, or back it up — not when a shortcut is invalid, not when two shortcuts collide, not when `config_revision` is
old, not when a value is out of range, and not when the file is missing or read-only. Starting,
using, and quitting Wayscriber without touching one of the editors above leaves the file's bytes,
size, mode, owner, and modification time exactly as you left them.

Incidental preference toggles are not editors. Flipping the status bar, the layout mode, the input
HUD, or any other chrome preference from the overlay applies to the current run and says so;
restart and the configured value comes back. Where a durable change is wanted, the control offers a
route into the configurator at the matching screen — press <kbd>F11</kbd>, or use the toast's
action button — and the change becomes durable when you Save there.

The three overlay editors do their writing on a background worker, so parsing, copying, and
syncing the file never stalls drawing or input. A preset slot or a swatch changes on screen as you
release the control and its toast follows a moment later, once the file has actually taken it — the
wording waits so it cannot claim a save that has not happened. A shortcut is the other way round:
nothing is rebound until the write succeeds, which is what lets a chord the file has meanwhile
given to another action be refused outright rather than un-done. Edits are written one at a time in
the order you make them, and one made just before you quit is finished before Wayscriber exits.

If one of the three editors cannot write the file — it is read-only, it cannot be parsed, or
another program is editing it — the change still applies to the running session and the toast says
the file did not get it. Your edit is never thrown away because the save failed. Two other outcomes
are reported as themselves rather than as a failed save: an edit the file already agrees with
writes nothing and says so, and a shortcut whose chord another action has claimed in the file since
this run started is refused outright, naming the owner, with the file left untouched.

When the configurator edits an existing file, it preserves TOML comments, section order, compatible
value formatting, and unrecognized settings. Unrecognized paths produce a configurator warning but
remain in the file for forward compatibility. Known values are still validated for the running
session, and a setting you change that the file spells with an old alias is renamed to its
canonical name as it is written — an alias you do not change keeps the spelling you gave it, in the
configurator and in the overlay editors alike. The configurator tracks the exact loaded contents
rather than relying on modification time; if the file is created, deleted, retargeted through a
symlink, or changed by another editor, reload it before saving. A save does
not expand omitted, unchanged defaults; when a setting that was omitted is edited, only that
changed setting and its required table path are added.
A save writes only what you changed: a value that loading clamped, normalized, deduplicated, or
reset keeps the text you authored, so editing one preference can never rewrite settings you did not
touch. Validation results are not exempt from that rule and never reach the file at all. A pending
revision migration reaches it only when you review and apply the proposal in the configurator and
then Save — see [`[keybindings]`](#keybindings---custom-keybindings).
The first save for a missing file is sparse as well: it writes the revision marker and only values
changed from the built-in defaults.
One deliberate consequence: a value the file holds out of range is clamped for the running session
but keeps its authored text on disk, and re-entering the clamped value in the configurator is a
zero-delta save that writes nothing — the file keeps the out-of-range text until you set the field
to some other value or edit it by hand.
Every section follows the same rule for unrecognized keys, including `[export]`, `[export.pdf]`,
and `[export.pdf.labels]`: a typo there is reported and kept, never dropped from the file, and it
does not stop the rest of the configuration from loading.

#### Backups

Every write copies the previous contents to a timestamped `config.toml.<timestamp>.bak` next to
`config.toml` first — a configurator Save and each of the three overlay editors alike. That copy is
the recovery path: to undo a change, copy the newest `.bak` back over `config.toml`. Nothing prunes
them, so delete the ones you no longer want.

There is no longer any other backup. Earlier releases kept a rolling copy under
`$XDG_STATE_HOME/wayscriber/config-backups/` to protect background writes made by the running
overlay and the tray; those background writers are gone, so nothing creates, reads, or prunes that
directory any more. If you have one from an older release it is left untouched as your own recovery
data — the files are ordinary TOML copies, and you can keep or delete the directory as you like.

#### Who writes what, when

Three stores and four mechanisms cover every preference Wayscriber saves for you:

- **Configurator Save** — writes the whole draft you edited, when you press Save.
- **Overlay editors** — the shortcut editor, preset slots, and quick-color palette, each writing
  only its own key at the moment you confirm the edit.
- **Runtime-UI writer** — a guarded, conditional write to `runtime-ui.toml`; see the list at the top
  of this section for what lives there and why.
- **Session autosave** — the session snapshot, not a configuration file at all.

Both `config.toml` mechanisms leave a timestamped `.bak` beside the file.

| You do this | It is saved to | By |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Drag the top toolbar | `runtime-ui.toml` | Runtime-UI writer |
| Cycle the top strip full ⇄ micro (<kbd>F2</kbd> or the micro chip) | `runtime-ui.toml` | Runtime-UI writer |
| Show or hide the toolbar (<kbd>F9</kbd>) | `runtime-ui.toml` — top pin | Runtime-UI writer |
| Pin, unpin, or minimize the top toolbar | `runtime-ui.toml` | Runtime-UI writer |
| Hide, show, or reorder an individual toolbar item | `runtime-ui.toml` | Runtime-UI writer |
| Pin a board | `runtime-ui.toml` | Runtime-UI writer |
| Switch layout mode (Simple/Regular/Advanced) in the overlay — the Settings segments or the strip's layout button | `runtime-ui.toml` | Runtime-UI writer |
| Toggle a toolbar section from Settings | `runtime-ui.toml` | Runtime-UI writer |
| Switch icons ⇄ text labels | `runtime-ui.toml` | Runtime-UI writer |
| Toggle the status bar, its interactivity, or one of its items; the board/page badges, floating badge, or zoom chip | `runtime-ui.toml` | Runtime-UI writer |
| Toggle click highlight or the highlight-tool ring | `runtime-ui.toml` — both at once | Runtime-UI writer |
| Toggle the input HUD | `runtime-ui.toml` | Runtime-UI writer |
| Toggle the Step section, delay sliders, tool preview, preset toasts, idle fade, extra colors, or context-aware UI | `runtime-ui.toml` | Runtime-UI writer |
| Save or clear a preset slot in the overlay | `config.toml` — that one `[presets.slot_N]` table | Overlay editor (with a timestamped `.bak`) |
| Recolor a quick color swatch in the overlay | `config.toml` — that one `[[drawing.quick_colors]]` entry | Overlay editor (with a timestamped `.bak`) |
| Rename, recolor, add, or delete a board | The session file, for boards marked `persist` | Configurator → Boards for the templates a new session starts from |
| Edit, unbind, or reset a shortcut in the overlay | `config.toml` — that one action's `[keybindings]` entry | Overlay editor (with a timestamped `.bak`) |
| Toggle session resume from the tray menu | Not editable from the tray | Tray → "Session persistence settings…" opens Configurator → Session |
| Press Save in the graphical configurator | `config.toml` — everything you edited | Configurator Save (with a timestamped `.bak`) |
| Change pen color, thickness, tool, or font size | Session file | Session autosave (needs `restore_tool_state`) |

Drawings, boards, pages, and per-page pan offsets belong to the session file (see `[session]`).
Everything else — zoom, freeze, presenter mode, light mode — is live state for the run and is not
saved at all. Presenter and light mode force some of the chrome above on or off while they run;
what gets saved is the value the mode will restore, so the mode's own housekeeping never becomes
your preference.

Every chrome toggle in that table is a runtime override layered over the value you authored, so
your `config.toml` still reads exactly as you wrote it and editing it there still wins: a
configurator Save reseeds the override, and the field you changed goes back to following the file.

If the graphical configurator can read the file but cannot parse its TOML or known value types, it
opens a clearly marked repair draft using built-in defaults. Saving that draft first creates a
backup of the unreadable source, retains unknown keys that can be separated safely when the TOML
structure itself was parseable, and replaces the unreadable known configuration. A transient reload
error leaves the last good document and unsaved draft in place; its revision guard still prevents
overwriting a changed file.

## Configuration File Location

The configuration file should be placed at:
- Linux: `~/.config/wayscriber/config.toml`
- The directory will be created automatically when you first create the config file. If the config
  path is a dangling symlink, missing parent directories for its final target are created as well.

## Example Configuration

See `config.example.toml` in the repository root for a complete example with documentation.

**Color Options:**
- **Named colors**: `"red"` (`#F5333F`), `"green"` (`#2EC27E`), `"blue"` (`#3584E4`), `"yellow"` (`#F6D32D`), `"orange"` (`#FF7800`), `"pink"` (`#C061CB`), `"white"` (`#FFFFFF`), `"black"` (`#241F31`) — named colors resolve to the tuned quick color palette
- **Hex strings**: `"#RRGGBB"` such as `"#FFB3BA"`, or `"#RRGGBBAA"` such as `"#FFB3BA80"` to carry alpha. Other hex-like strings such as `"#GG0000"` or `"#12345"` keep config-load compatibility but fall back to red with a warning; the configurator rejects them for quick color fields.
- **RGB arrays**: `[255, 0, 0]` for red, `[0, 255, 0]` for green, etc. A fourth component sets alpha: `[255, 0, 0, 128]`.
- **Alpha**: colors are opaque unless an alpha component says otherwise, and opaque colors are written back in the three-component form they have always used — so adding alpha never rewrites an existing palette. The marker and highlighter multiply their own opacity on top of any color alpha rather than replacing it.

**Quick Colors:**
- `[[drawing.quick_colors]]` entries define an ordered palette.
- The first eight entries are selected by <kbd>R</kbd>/<kbd>G</kbd>/<kbd>B</kbd>/<kbd>Y</kbd>/<kbd>O</kbd>/<kbd>P</kbd>/<kbd>W</kbd>/<kbd>K</kbd>; missing first-eight entries fall back to built-in defaults.
- The built-in defaults use the tuned hex palette shown above (`#F5333F`, `#2EC27E`, `#3584E4`, `#F6D32D`, `#FF7800`, `#C061CB`, `#FFFFFF`, `#241F31`). Named colors resolve to the same tuned values, so `default_color = "red"`, named quick color entries, and board auto-adjust pen colors all select the matching swatch.
- The implicit default toolbar palette also preserves Cyan, Purple, and Gray as expanded toolbar colors, while the radial menu keeps the original first-eight color ring.
- Extra entries have no quick-color action binding; explicit extra entries appear in toolbar and radial palette UIs, capped to the first 24 colors.
- Help overlay badges are shown for the first eight shortcut-backed entries only.
- The screen eyedropper is available with <kbd>I</kbd>, from the toolbar color section, from the color picker popup, and from the command palette. Rebind `keybindings.colors.pick_screen_color` if you prefer another shortcut. It samples the captured desktop currently visible through Wayscriber; on a transparent board it can briefly use screen freeze when no captured image exists.

**Runtime Adjustments:**
- **Pen thickness**: Use <kbd>+</kbd>/<kbd>-</kbd> keys or scroll wheel (range: 1-50px)
- **Eraser size**: Use <kbd>+</kbd>/<kbd>-</kbd> keys or scroll wheel when eraser tool is active (range: 1-50px)
- **Eraser mode**: Use <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+E</kbd> to toggle brush vs stroke erasing
- **Blur style**: Run **Cycle Blur Style** from the command palette to step through blur → pixelate → secure → black out (unbound by default; bind `cycle_blur_style`)
- **Arrow style**: Run **Cycle Arrow Style** from the command palette to step through standard → pointy → curved → double (unbound by default; bind `cycle_arrow_style`). With arrows selected it restyles those in one undo step; with nothing selected it sets the style for the next arrow
- **Marker opacity**: Use <kbd>Ctrl+Alt</kbd> + <kbd>↑</kbd>/<kbd>↓</kbd>
- **Pen smoothing**: Run **Increase / Decrease Pen Smoothing** from the command palette, or bind `increase_pen_smoothing` / `decrease_pen_smoothing` (see [Pen smoothing](#pen-smoothing))
- **Text font**: <kbd>Shift+T</kbd> steps through `font_cycle`; **Font Picker** in the command palette opens the full list (see [Font cycle](#font-cycle) and [Font picker](#font-picker))
- **Regular polygon sides**: Use the Shapes popover Sides control (range: 3-12)
- **Font size**: Use <kbd>Ctrl+Shift++</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl+Shift+-</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd> + scroll (range: 8-72px)

**Defaults:**
- Color: Red
- Thickness: 3.0px
- Eraser size: 12.0px
- Eraser mode: Brush
- Marker opacity: 0.32
- Font cycle: Sans, Monospace, Serif
- Pen smoothing: 3 of 6
- Fill enabled: false
- Polygon sides: 5
- Font size: 32.0px
- Font family/weight/style: Sans / bold / normal
- Text background: false
- Hit-test tolerance: 6.0px (linear threshold: 400)
- Undo stack limit: 100
- Drag mapping: Drag=Pen, Shift+Drag=Line, Ctrl+Drag=Rect, Ctrl+Shift+Drag=Arrow, Tab+Drag=Ellipse

#### Font cycle

`font_family` sets the font text is written in. `font_cycle` is the short list
that <kbd>Shift+T</kbd> steps through, for changing it without leaving the
overlay.

```toml
[drawing]
font_cycle = ["Sans", "Monospace", "Serif"]
```

Any installed family name is valid. Blank and repeated entries are dropped when
the configuration loads, because a repeat makes the key look like it skipped.
An empty list turns the action off.

The toolbar's style pill carries a **Bold** toggle and a button showing the
family in use; the button opens the font picker. Bold applies to selected text,
or to the next label you type. Under width pressure, Bold leaves with the
smoothing stepper; the family button remains until the whole style pill is
hidden in the most compact layout.

Bold is a literal two-state control: it is checked for `font_weight = "bold"`
and writes `"bold"` or `"normal"`. Numeric weights such as `700` still render at
that Pango weight, but leave the toggle unchecked because the toggle cannot
represent every numeric value.

In the configurator this is a row per font under **Font cycle**, each row a
searchable dropdown over everything installed — every family drawn in its own
face, so you pick one by looking at it. Rows move up and down, and the order
they are in is the order <kbd>Shift+T</kbd> walks. A family your config names
that this machine does not have says so under the row rather than quietly
showing a different one.

With text or a sticky note selected, <kbd>Shift+T</kbd> restyles that text and
leaves the tool setting alone. With nothing selected it sets what the next label
will be written in. A family that is not in the list steps to the first entry,
so the key always goes somewhere.

The toolbar family button is independent of this list: it shows the current
family and opens the full picker below.

Family names are matched without regard to case, the way fontconfig resolves
them: `sans` and `Sans` are one font, so `["Sans", "sans"]` loads as one entry.
A family name containing a comma is fine — the list is a TOML array, and the
configurator edits it as a list rather than as one line of text.

#### Font picker

`font_cycle` is the short list you reach for mid-demo. The **Font Picker** is
the long way round: a modal over every font installed on the system, for the
times the list does not have what you want.

It applies a font the same way <kbd>Shift+T</kbd> does — to selected text, or to
the tool. It does not edit `font_cycle`; that list is set in the config file or
the configurator. Use the picker to find out what a family looks like, then put
its name in the list if you want it a keystroke away.

Run **Font Picker** from the command palette, bind `open_font_picker`, or click
the font button in the toolbar's style pill — the one showing the family in use.

| Key | Does |
|-----|------|
| Type | Filter by name |
| <kbd>↑</kbd> <kbd>↓</kbd> <kbd>PgUp</kbd> <kbd>PgDn</kbd> <kbd>Home</kbd> <kbd>End</kbd> | Move the highlight |
| Wheel | Scroll three rows a tick |
| <kbd>Tab</kbd> | Switch between all fonts and monospace only |
| <kbd>Enter</kbd> | Apply |
| <kbd>Esc</kbd> | Cancel |

Holding an arrow or a page key keeps moving, and speeds up the longer you hold
it — a list of every installed font is too long to cross at one flat rate. Let
go and it starts over at the slow rate, so a short press is still one row.

The wheel belongs to the picker while it is open. It does not reach the pen
behind the panel — which is also true of the colour picker, the precise-entry
popup, the board picker, a context menu, and the eyedropper and region
selectors.

Every row is drawn in the font it names, because nobody picks a typeface by
reading its name. The picker opens on the font already in use, and fonts chosen
here come back to the top of the list next time.

The panel sizes itself to the output it comes up on: a short screen shows fewer
rows rather than a panel running off the bottom edge. Long family names are
shortened with an ellipsis rather than written over what is next to them.

The font list is read once, the first time the picker opens — one enumeration
covering both the full list and the monospace filter, so <kbd>Tab</kbd> costs
nothing. It is deliberately not read at startup: the overlay is spawned per
keybind toggle, so anything on that path is paid every time you reach for it.

#### Text halo

Text is drawn with a contrasting outline so it stays readable over any
background. Wayscriber picks that halo color from **what the label sits on**,
sampled from the canvas just before the glyphs are painted.

The halo is enabled by default. Disable it globally for the overlay, text-entry
caret, page thumbnails, and canvas exports with:

```toml
[drawing]
text_halo_enabled = false
```

This removes the contrasting outline. `text_background_enabled` is separate,
so its optional box still appears when enabled.

That means a whiteboard, a blackboard, a frozen screen, a zoomed screen, and a
region already covered by a blur or a filled shape all give the right answer.
PNG export samples the same way, so an exported image matches the screen.

PDF export cannot be sampled — a PDF page is vector, with no pixels to read
back. There the page's own background color is used instead. A board on a plain
background therefore picks the same halo in PDF as it does on screen; a label
sitting on top of a filled shape or a blur does not, because in PDF nothing can
see what was painted underneath it. A page whose backdrop is an image falls back
further still, because one brightness for a whole photograph would be a guess.

Export to PNG when a label sits over other drawing and the halo has to match.

On a transparent board with no frozen or zoomed capture there is also nothing to
sample: the desktop shows through the compositor and those pixels were never
Wayscriber's to read. The halo then falls back to a rule based on the text color
itself, which is what every case used before.

#### Pen smoothing

A pointer path carries the shake of the hand that drew it. `pen_smoothing`
removes that shake from freehand and marker strokes.

```toml
[drawing]
pen_smoothing = 3   # 0 - 6, where 0 keeps the exact drawn path
```

**Smoothing runs when you lift the pen, not while you draw.** Smoothing a point
needs the points on either side of it, so a live smoother cannot draw the newest
sample until the next one arrives, and the line trails the cursor. On a projector
that lag is visible to the room. Running on release keeps the live stroke exactly
on the pointer and pays for the smoothing once, on a finished path.

Both endpoints are pinned. A stroke starts and stops where you started and
stopped it, at every level.

| Level | Result |
|-------|--------|
| 0 | The exact path you drew |
| 3 | The default. Clean, and still your line |
| 6 | Very smooth |

The level applies to the Pen and the Marker. The Eraser is not smoothed: its path
decides what gets erased, so moving it would change the result rather than the
look.

A tablet stroke is smoothed too, because its path shakes like any other. Its
**pressure values** are not touched — each smoothed point keeps the thickness
that was sampled with it, so pen dynamics survive.

A stroke is stored as the points it ended up with, so nothing about smoothing
changes how a shape is written. The level itself is remembered with the rest of
the tool settings, so a session restores at the level it was saved at. A session
written before this existed has no level recorded and restores at whatever
`pen_smoothing` your config says.

The level is also on the toolbar, as a **Smoothing** stepper in the style pill
whenever the Pen or Marker is up. It reads `Off` at zero. The stepper is one of
the first things the pill drops on a narrow output; the actions below still
reach it there.

### `[arrow]` - Arrow Geometry

Controls the appearance of arrow annotations.

```toml
[arrow]
# Minimum arrowhead length in pixels. The head also scales with stroke width
# (three times the thickness), so this acts as the floor for thin strokes.
length = 20.0

# Arrowhead half-angle in degrees (15-60). Smaller is a sharper, narrower head.
angle_degrees = 26.0

# Place the arrowhead at the end of the line instead of the start
head_at_end = true

# Shape of the next arrow drawn: "standard", "pointy", "curved", or "double"
style = "standard"
```

**Defaults:**
- Length: 20.0px
- Angle: 26.0°
- Head at end: true
- Style: standard

**Arrow styles.** Every arrow stores its own style, so it keeps that style through save/load, undo, duplicate, and resize. `style` seeds new arrows only — changing it never restyles anything already drawn. Set the startup style here or on the configurator's Arrow tab; pick one at runtime from the arrow tool's style pill or the **Cycle Arrow Style** action; the choice persists with the rest of the tool state, which takes precedence over this key (see [`[session]`](#session---session-persistence)).

| Style | What it draws |
|---|---|
| Standard | Tapered shaft fused into one head. What arrows looked like before styles existed, and what a session written before them loads as. |
| Pointy | The same head with its rear notched forward into a concave V, for a dart silhouette. |
| Curved | Shaft follows an arc instead of a straight line, so an arrow can route around whatever sits between the pointer and its target. Drag the round handle at the arc's midpoint to reshape it; hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> to snap the bend to tenths. |
| Double | Parallel-sided shaft with a head at both ends. `head_at_end` has no effect on it. |

### `[presets]` - Quick Tool Slots

Configure 3-5 tool presets that you can apply via hotkeys or the toolbar strip.

Saving or clearing a slot from the overlay writes that one `[presets.slot_N]` table back to
`config.toml`, leaving every other setting and your comments alone and copying the previous file to
a timestamped `.bak` first. Names and the advanced fields are still edited in the configurator's
Presets screen. If the file cannot be written the slot still changes for the run, and the toast
says the save failed.

```toml
# Spotlight tool: dims the whole overlay except the regions you draw, so
# attention lands where you point. Select the tool from the toolbar or bind
# `select_spotlight_tool`.
[spotlight]
# Starting magnification for newly drawn spotlights (1.0 - 4.0). Existing
# spotlights keep their own saved value. The toolbar changes this in 0.25 steps.
magnification = 1.0

# How strongly the area outside every spotlight is dimmed (0.1 - 0.95)
dim_opacity = 0.6

# Fraction of each spotlight radius spent fading out at the edge (0.0 - 0.9).
# 0.0 gives a hard-edged opening.
feather = 0.35

# Magnification needs complete pixels beneath the canvas. Solid boards, Freeze,
# Zoom, captured regions, and persisted-image exports provide them. On a live
# transparent board, Wayscriber keeps the dim opening and asks you to Freeze the
# screen; transparent exports with magnified spotlights fail instead of silently
# saving an unmagnified image.

[presets]
slot_count = 5

[presets.slot_1]
name = "Red pen"
tool = "pen"
color = "red"
size = 3.0
marker_opacity = 0.32
fill_enabled = false
font_size = 32.0
text_background_enabled = false
arrow_length = 20.0
arrow_angle = 30.0
arrow_head_at_end = true
show_status_bar = true

# Optional full per-tool profile captured by newly saved presets.
[presets.slot_1.tool_settings]
eraser_size = 18.0

[presets.slot_1.tool_settings.pen]
color = "red"
size = 3.0

[presets.slot_1.tool_settings.line]
color = "green"
size = 6.0

[presets.slot_1.tool_settings.rect]
color = "blue"
size = 4.0

[presets.slot_1.tool_settings.ellipse]
color = "orange"
size = 4.0

[presets.slot_1.tool_settings.arrow]
color = "yellow"
size = 5.0

[presets.slot_1.tool_settings.blur]
color = "black"
size = 12.0

[presets.slot_1.tool_settings.marker]
color = "yellow"
size = 20.0

[presets.slot_1.tool_settings.step_marker]
color = "white"
size = 28.0
```

**Required fields:** `tool`, `color`, `size`  
**Optional fields:** `tool_settings`, `eraser_kind`, `eraser_mode`, `marker_opacity`, `fill_enabled`, `font_size`, `text_background_enabled`, `arrow_length`, `arrow_angle`, `arrow_head_at_end`, `polygon_sides`, `show_status_bar`, `drag_tools`

When `tool_settings` is present, applying the preset restores the full drawing profile for all
tools, including StepMarker size and Eraser size, then activates `tool`. Legacy presets without
`tool_settings` keep the old behavior and apply only `color`/`size` to the selected `tool`.
The top-level `color` and `size` are retained for compatibility, readability, and toolbar previews.

### `[history]` - Undo/Redo Playback

Controls delayed undo/redo playback and the optional Step section in the toolbar.

```toml
[history]
# Delay between steps for undo-all/redo-all (50 - 5000 ms)
undo_all_delay_ms = 1000
redo_all_delay_ms = 1000

# Show the Step section in the toolbar
custom_section_enabled = false

# Delay between steps for custom undo/redo (50 - 5000 ms)
custom_undo_delay_ms = 1000
custom_redo_delay_ms = 1000

# Number of steps to run in custom undo/redo (1 - 500)
custom_undo_steps = 5
custom_redo_steps = 5
```

**Notes:**
- `undo_all_delay_ms` / `redo_all_delay_ms` drive the "Undo all (delay)" and "Redo all (delay)" toolbar actions.
- `custom_section_enabled` reveals the Step buttons in the Canvas overflow popover; those buttons use the custom delays and step counts above.

### `[performance]` - Performance Tuning

Controls rendering performance and smoothness.

```toml
[performance]
# Number of buffers for rendering (2, 3, or 4)
# 2 = double buffering (low memory)
# 3 = triple buffering (recommended, smooth)
# 4 = quad buffering (ultra-smooth on high refresh displays)
buffer_count = 3

# Enable vsync frame synchronization
# false lowers drawing latency; true prevents tearing and limits rendering to display refresh rate
enable_vsync = false

# Max FPS when VSync is disabled (0 = unlimited)
# 120 keeps pen latency low without uncapped CPU usage; set to 0 only for profiling
max_fps_no_vsync = 120

# UI animation frame rate (0-240; 0 = unlimited)
# Higher values smooth UI effects at the cost of more redraws
ui_animation_fps = 30
```

**Buffer Count:**
- **2**: Double buffering - minimal memory usage, may flicker on fast drawing
- **3**: Triple buffering - recommended default, smooth drawing
- **4**: Quad buffering - for high-refresh displays (144Hz+), ultra-smooth

**VSync:**
- **false** (default): Capped by `max_fps_no_vsync`; lower drawing latency, with possible tearing
- **true**: Synchronizes with display refresh rate, no tearing, but input-to-commit latency is bounded by refresh cadence

**Max FPS (VSync off):**
- **120** (default): Low-latency drawing without uncapped redraw loops
- **60**: Lower CPU/GPU use, but latency may feel closer to one 60 Hz frame interval
- **144/165/240+**: Use when it matches your display and the machine handles the extra rendering work
- **0**: Unlimited; mostly for profiling because it can spin CPU/GPU hard

**UI Animation FPS:**
- **30** (default): Smooth enough for most effects
- **0**: Unlimited (renders every frame while animations are active)
- Values through **240** improve smoothness at the cost of extra redraws; larger values are clamped

**Defaults:**
- Buffer count: 3 (triple buffering)
- VSync: false
- Max FPS (VSync off): 120
- UI animation FPS: 30

**Tradeoff:**
Disabling vsync improves input latency but may allow tearing and higher CPU/GPU usage. On weaker
PCs, laptops, or battery-sensitive setups, restore `enable_vsync = true` or lower
`max_fps_no_vsync` if you notice heat, fan noise, battery drain, or compositor smoothness issues.

**Measurement note:**
With `WAYSCRIBER_PERF_LOG=1`, the `perf.input_to_paint_latency proxy=input_to_wayland_commit`
line reports an input-to-Wayland-commit proxy metric. It measures from input sample receipt inside
the app to Wayland surface commit. It is not photons-on-screen display latency; compositor
scheduling, display scanout, and hardware can add more latency outside Wayscriber.
The `perf.render_stage` line also reports Spotlight magnifier work separately as
`spotlight_snapshot_ms` and `spotlight_paint_ms`, together with the region count,
regional/full-surface snapshot strategy, and copied source-pixel count. At 1× these
fields remain zero/`none`, because no source snapshot is created.

In local continuous-drawing measurements, 120 FPS low-latency mode held p95 around 8-9 ms and
p99 around 8-9 ms for this proxy metric. Isolated max spikes existed, but p99 stayed under 16 ms.

### `[tray]` - System Tray

Controls the main system tray icon. Changes take effect after restarting the daemon.

```toml
[tray]
# Options: "auto", "symbolic", "colored"
icon_style = "auto"
```

- `auto` (default) uses a theme-adaptive symbolic icon on supported desktops and colored fallback pixmaps on known-incompatible tray hosts, including Omarchy/Quickshell, Noctalia/Quickshell, and COSMIC.
- `symbolic` always requests the theme-adaptive icon. The tray host chooses its visible color.
- `colored` always publishes the yellow, scale-aware fallback pixmaps.

`WAYSCRIBER_TRAY_FORCE_PIXMAP=1` takes precedence over this setting and also disables named menu icons for compatibility with tray hosts that render them incorrectly.

The tray menu reads the configuration to draw itself and changes none of it. Its **Session
persistence settings…** entry launches the configurator on the Session screen, where the change is
made and saved.

### `[updates]` - Update Notifications

Wayscriber never installs updates. This section controls only whether it *tells you* that a newer release exists and points at the instructions for your install method.

```toml
[updates]
check = true         # ask wayscriber.com whether a newer release exists
notify = true        # one desktop notification per release
interval_hours = 24  # minimum 1, maximum 720
```

- `check` (default `true`) lets the daemon fetch `https://wayscriber.com/latest.json` once per interval and compare its version to this build. The request carries no Wayscriber or user identifier, no Wayscriber version, and no query parameters; the HTTP client's version is suppressed too. It goes out through whichever of `curl` or `wget` is installed, so it uses the system CA store and proxy settings, with client config files and Wget's `.netrc` credential lookup disabled. One check is one request — an installed client that fails is not retried with the other one — and the response is cut off past 64 KiB.
- `notify` (default `true`) shows at most one desktop notification per release, suppressed while the overlay is active. With it off, the notice still appears in the About window and the tray menu.
- `interval_hours` (default `24`) is clamped to 1–720 hours.

The result is cached in `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/wayscriber/update-check.json` (normally `~/.cache/wayscriber/update-check.json`); deleting it just makes the next check look like the first one. The cache records the last attempt and the last *success* separately: attempts drive the interval, successes drive the "checked N ago" line, and a newer failed attempt is reported with it, so a failed check neither makes a stale result look verified nor hides itself behind a true-but-older age. Failed explicit checks (`--check-update`, About's "Check now") also count toward the interval, since the request was already made. If the cache cannot be written, the interval is still enforced in memory for the life of the process.

If the config file exists but cannot be parsed, the background check does not run: Wayscriber cannot confirm this section, so it assumes the stricter setting until the file is valid again.

Ways to switch it off, strongest first:

1. Build with `WAYSCRIBER_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` — the check is compiled out and nothing at runtime can re-enable it (for distributions that forbid outbound version checks).
2. Export `WAYSCRIBER_DISABLE_UPDATE_CHECK=1` — overrides `check` for that run. The documented falsey words (`0`, `false`, `no`, `off`, `disable`, `disabled`, empty) leave the check on; any other value opts out. `wayscriber --check-update` still works, since asking for a check is consent.
3. Set `check = false` here.

`wayscriber --check-update` prints the installed version, the newest release, and the update instructions URL without installing anything.

### `[ui]` - User Interface

Controls visual indicators, overlays, and UI styling.

```toml
[ui]

```

**Status Bar:**
- Shows current color, pen thickness, and active tool
- Press <kbd>F1</kbd>/<kbd>F10</kbd> to toggle help overlay
- Fully customizable styling (fonts, colors, sizes)

**Position Options:**
- `"top-left"`: Upper left corner
- `"top-right"`: Upper right corner
- `"bottom-left"`: Lower left corner (default)
- `"bottom-right"`: Lower right corner

**Theme & Motion:**
- **Theme**: `theme` selects the overlay chrome theme — `"auto"` (default), `"dark"`, or `"light"`. `"auto"` currently resolves to dark chrome; `"light"` takes effect progressively as overlay surfaces adopt the runtime theme (until then it also renders dark).
- **Reduced motion**: `reduced_motion = "on"` disables overlay chrome animations (toast and flash fades render instantly; coverage extends to more surfaces as they adopt the shared animation envelopes). `"off"` keeps full motion. `"auto"` (default) is reserved for a future desktop-portal query of the system reduce-motion preference and currently behaves like `"off"` (full motion).

**UI Styling:**
- **Font sizes**: Customize text size for status bar and help overlay
- **Colors**: All RGBA values (0.0-1.0 range) with transparency control
- **Layout**: Padding, line height, dot size, border width all configurable
- **Click highlight**: Enable presenter-style click halos with adjustable radius, colors, and duration; by default the halo follows your current pen color (set `use_pen_color = false` to keep a fixed color)
- **Input HUD**: `ui.input_hud` shows a live row of keystroke/click chips for demos and screencasts (see `[ui.input_hud]` below)
- **Highlight tool ring**: `show_on_highlight_tool = true` keeps a persistent halo visible while the highlight tool is active
- **Light mode**: `force_in_light_mode = true` preserves the default behavior of enabling click highlights on light mode entry; set it to `false` to keep the current click highlight state
- **Context menu**: `ui.context_menu.enabled` toggles right-click / keyboard menus
- **Output focus**: `multi_monitor_enabled` controls output-cycling shortcuts; `active_output_badge` shows the current monitor in the status bar
- **GNOME fallback**: `preferred_output` pins the xdg-shell overlay to a specific monitor; `xdg_fullscreen` requests fullscreen instead of maximized; `xdg_focus_loss_behavior` controls whether losing focus closes (`exit`) or keeps (`stay`) the overlay
- **Radial menu trigger**: `radial_menu_mouse_binding` selects which mouse button opens radial menu (`middle` default, `right`, or `disabled`)

**Multi-monitor behavior:**
- Use `focus_prev_output` / `focus_next_output` (default: <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+Shift+←</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl+Alt+Shift+→</kbd>) to move overlay focus between outputs.
- Toolbar surfaces and status bar follow the active output when focus changes.
- Output switching is blocked while capture, frozen, or zoom is active/in progress; finish or exit those modes first.
- Command palette (`Ctrl+K` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`) includes hidden aliases, so searching `monitor` or `display` finds output actions.
- For GNOME/xdg fallback, set `preferred_output` (or env override `WAYSCRIBER_XDG_OUTPUT`) to pin the overlay to a specific monitor.

**Defaults:**
- Theme: auto (currently dark)
- Reduced motion: auto (full motion)
- Show status bar: true
- Interactive status bar segments: true
- All status bar content items: true
- Show frozen badge: false
- Position: bottom-left
- Radial menu mouse trigger: middle
- Status bar font: 21px
- Help overlay font: 14px
- Semi-transparent dark backgrounds with muted borders

### `[ui.input_hud]` - Input HUD (keystrokes and clicks)

A live row of keycap-style chips showing what you press, for demos and
screencasts. Toggle it with `toggle_input_hud` (default
<kbd>Ctrl+Shift+K</kbd>) or from the command palette; the Settings popover has
an **Input HUD** checkbox. The runtime toggle applies to the current run only;
`ui.input_hud.enabled` is the default it starts from, edited in the
configurator. A config file that already bound <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+K</kbd> to
another action keeps it and starts the HUD unbound — see the
[`[keybindings]` notes](#keybindings---custom-keybindings) — so pick a free
shortcut for `toggle_input_hud` if you want a key for it.

Chips appear on the right and push older chips left. Key chords use the same
names the keybinding config and help overlay print (`Ctrl+Shift+Z`, `Space`,
`Esc`, `F10`, `↑`); mouse and scroll events use rounded pills (`Click`,
`Right Click`, `Scroll ↑`). Holding a key coalesces into a counter
(`Backspace ×7`) when `combine_repeats` is on. Each chip holds for
`display_ms` after its last press, then fades over `fade_ms`.

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | bool | `false` | Start with the HUD on |
| `mode` | enum | `"auto"` | `auto`, `overlay`, or `system` |
| `position` | enum | `"bottom-center"` | Nine screen anchors (3×3 grid) |
| `show_mouse` | bool | `true` | Show buttons and scroll |
| `show_bare_modifiers` | bool | `true` | Show lone Ctrl/Shift/Alt/Super taps |
| `display_ms` | u64 | `1600` | Hold before fading (200–30000) |
| `fade_ms` | u64 | `350` | Fade duration (0–5000) |
| `max_entries` | usize | `6` | Simultaneous chips (1–16) |
| `combine_repeats` | bool | `true` | Coalesce repeats into `×N` |
| `font_size` | f64 | `18.0` | Chip label size (6–72) |

**Input sources.** A Wayland client only receives input delivered to its *own*
surfaces, so what the HUD can see depends on the mode:

- `"overlay"` (works everywhere, no permissions): shows only the keys, clicks,
  and scrolls Wayscriber itself receives. That covers the primary presenter
  workflow — you are drawing on screen while talking. During Light Mode
  passthrough there is nothing to report, because input goes to the app
  underneath.
- `"system"`: a reader thread on libinput/evdev shows *all* input on the seat,
  including what flows to the app underneath during passthrough or while the
  overlay is hidden. This requires a build with the `input-monitor` cargo
  feature (opt-in, not in the default feature set) **and** read access to
  `/dev/input`, which normally means `input` group membership:

  ```bash
  sudo usermod -aG input "$USER"   # then log out and back in
  ```

  When either requirement is missing, the HUD falls back to overlay mode and
  shows a warning toast naming the actual cause — an unreadable `/dev/input`
  gets the group guidance above, while an empty seat, an uncompilable keyboard
  layout, or a read error each say so instead. The same fallback happens when
  the seat has no readable keyboard, pointer, or tablet device, so system mode
  never sits there silently reporting nothing. Capture follows the session's
  own seat (`XDG_SEAT`, defaulting to `seat0`), and devices are attributed to
  seats through udev exactly as libinput does it, so on a multi-seat machine
  another seat's hardware never counts as yours.

  Switching to system capture is a handshake: the HUD keeps reporting overlay
  input until the reader has opened the seat and found a usable device, and
  only then announces `Input HUD: system-wide input`. Nothing is lost or
  double-reported in between, and a seat that turns out to be unusable simply
  stays on overlay with the warning above.
- `"auto"` (default): system-wide capture when it is available, overlay-only
  otherwise, with no warning. The fallback is silent however it is reached —
  missing permissions, an empty seat, or a reader that fails after starting —
  and only the log records why; enabling the HUD still toasts which source you
  ended up with.

While the system source is active it reports every press once — the overlay
hooks stay silent, so nothing is shown twice.

**Privacy.** System mode sees every keystroke on the seat, including passwords
typed into other applications. This is inherent to the feature class (KeyCastr
and showmethekey have the same exposure). Mitigations shipped: the HUD is off
by default, system mode is an explicit opt-in on an opt-in build, one chord
toggles it off, and chip labels are render-only — they are never logged and
never written to a session file. Wayscriber cannot detect password fields from
this side of the compositor and does not pretend to.

**Known limitations.**
- System mode reads the keyboard layout from the environment
  (`XKB_DEFAULT_LAYOUT` and friends), which can differ from the compositor's
  live layout. Overlay mode always matches the compositor.
- GTK toolbar surfaces are separate windows, so clicks on them do not appear
  in overlay mode; system mode covers them.
- The two modes count held keys slightly differently. Overlay mode ticks the
  `×N` counter from Wayscriber's own auto-repeat, which deliberately excludes
  one-shot action keys such as <kbd>Enter</kbd> and <kbd>Tab</kbd>; system
  mode follows the keymap's own repeat flags, so those keys do count there.
- System mode enumerates devices once at startup, so a keyboard plugged in
  afterwards is picked up by libinput but a seat that was empty at startup
  falls back to overlay; toggle the HUD off and on to re-evaluate. Unplugging
  a keyboard while a key is held retires only that keyboard's held keys, so a
  modifier still down on another keyboard — and session state such as Caps
  Lock or the selected layout group — keeps working.
- Typing into Wayscriber's own text tool *is* shown (that is the point when
  demoing). IME-composed text and touch events are not shown in this release.
- Focus Mode hides chrome, not presentation aids: the HUD keeps rendering,
  the same decision click highlights use.

### `[presenter_mode]` - Presenter Mode

Control which UI elements presenter mode hides and how tools behave when it is active.

```toml
[presenter_mode]
hide_status_bar = true
hide_toolbars = true
toolbar_mode = "hidden"
hide_tool_preview = true
close_help_overlay = true
enable_click_highlight = true
enable_input_hud = false
tool_behavior = "force-highlight"
show_toast = true
```

`enable_input_hud = true` forces the input HUD on at presenter-mode entry and
restores the previous value on exit; while it is forced, the manual toggle is
ignored (the same contract `enable_click_highlight` follows).

**Toolbar mode options** (what `hide_toolbars` does to the top strip):
- `"hidden"` (default): hide the top strip
- `"micro"`: collapse the top strip to the 44px micro chip (active tool glyph in a ring of the current color)

**Tool behavior options:**
- `"keep"`: Leave the active tool unchanged
- `"force-highlight"`: Switch to highlight on entry, allow tool changes
- `"force-highlight-locked"`: Switch to highlight and lock tools while presenting

### Light Passthrough Mode

Light mode hides UI chrome and sets the overlay to click-through passthrough until drawing is explicitly enabled. `toggle_light_mode` defaults to <kbd>F6</kbd>, but that is a Wayscriber in-overlay shortcut: it works while the overlay still has focus. Once passthrough is active, normal keyboard and pointer input goes to the app underneath, so do not rely on in-overlay shortcuts as the way back out. Compositor/global shortcuts should call the daemon commands below for reliable control.

This mode requires compositor overlay support through layer-shell. It is disabled on the xdg fallback because regular app windows cannot reliably stay visible as click-through shell overlays while keyboard and pointer input go to apps underneath. On stock GNOME Wayland, Freeze may still work for still-image capture when portal capture is available, but it is not a live passthrough replacement. True passthrough would require a GNOME Shell extension companion.

For compositor/global shortcuts while passthrough is active, run:

```sh
wayscriber --light-toggle
wayscriber --light-draw-toggle
wayscriber --light-draw-on
wayscriber --light-draw-off
```

Use `--light-draw-on` on key/button press and `--light-draw-off` on release for a non-sticky draw-while-held shortcut. The raw `--daemon-action` form remains available for scripts.

### `[ui.toolbar]` - Floating Toolbar

Controls the unified top toolbar (<kbd>F9</kbd> toggles visibility; <kbd>F2</kbd> cycles the top strip full → micro → hidden).

```

**Behavior:**
- **Icon/text mode**: `use_icons` switches between compact icons and labeled buttons.
- **Scale**: `scale` multiplies toolbar UI sizing (useful for HiDPI when output scale=1).
- **Colors**: `show_more_colors` toggles the extended palette row.
- **Layout**: `layout_mode` picks a preset complexity level; `mode_overrides` lets you customize each mode.
- **Actions**: `show_actions_section` controls the basic Undo/Redo/Clear group in the Canvas popover; `show_actions_advanced` controls the separate advanced action group.
- **Zoom actions**: `show_zoom_actions` toggles the zoom controls in the Canvas popover.
- **Pages**: `show_pages_section` toggles the page navigation block in the Canvas popover.
- **Boards**: `show_boards_section` toggles the board navigation block in the Canvas popover.
- **Presets**: `show_presets` hides/shows the top-strip preset slots.
- **Text controls**: `show_text_controls` keeps font size/family visible even when text isn’t active.
- **Multi-step undo/redo**: `show_step_section` hides/shows the Step Undo/Redo block in the Canvas popover.
- **Settings**: Settings is always reachable from the top-strip overflow popover.
- **Delays**: `show_delay_sliders` shows the timed undo/redo-all sliders in the Canvas popover's Step section.
- **Marker opacity**: the marker opacity slider appears when the marker tool is active; `show_marker_opacity_section` keeps it visible even when using other tools.
- **Polygon tools**: Full mode shows Triangle, Parallelogram, Rhombus, Regular Polygon, and Freeform Polygon under the compact Polygons picker. Simple mode exposes them in the Shapes picker.
- **Context-aware UI**: `context_aware_ui` shows/hides tool-specific controls (colors, thickness, arrow labels, etc.) based on the active tool; disable to always show all controls.
- **Preset toasts**: `show_preset_toasts` enables toast confirmations for preset apply/save/clear.
- **Automatic guidance**: `show_onboarding_hints` controls first-run cards, discovery tips, and shortcut coaching. Discovery and coaching tips offer **Got it** (permanently acknowledge that tip) and **Tip settings…** (acknowledge it, then open the Configurator at this setting); the toolbar-hidden recovery tip keeps **Show** as its primary control and offers the same settings route. Using the board picker, bottom-right zoom controls, or Canvas popover also acknowledges the matching tip. Clicking the message body dismisses a tip only for the current run; an unattended tip stops after three appearances. Set this option to `false` to disable all automatic tutorials on later overlay launches; the running overlay does not live-reload this Configurator change. The guided tour remains available manually, and capability, safety, and configuration warnings are unaffected. Completed profiles migrated from onboarding versions before v6 are not enrolled in the later status-bar, Canvas, and zoom tip series. If onboarding progress cannot be saved, automatic guidance is disabled for that run and an actionable persistence warning is shown.
- **Shape size readout**: `show_shape_size_readout` controls the live rectangle and ellipse preview dimensions, measured in logical board pixels. Ellipse values match the diameter that will be committed, so an odd drag span rounds down to the nearest even diameter. It defaults to `true` and is separate from `capture.region.show_size_readout`, which describes a region-capture selection.
- **Capability warnings**: `show_capabilities_warning` independently controls compositor limitation warnings; disabling tutorials does not hide safety, configuration, or capability diagnostics.
- **Tool preview**: `show_tool_preview` toggles the cursor bubble.
- **Offsets**: `top_offset` and `top_offset_y` are the authored default top-toolbar position. Dragging the strip saves its position as a runtime preference in `runtime-ui.toml` and leaves these untouched; editing one here again takes over from the saved drag.
- **Force inline**: `force_inline` (or `WAYSCRIBER_FORCE_INLINE_TOOLBARS`) skips layer-shell toolbars.
- **Shortcut editing**: hold `rebind_modifier` while clicking a bindable toolbar action to capture a replacement shortcut. The command palette also exposes edit, unbind, and reset controls for each configurable action (<kbd>Ctrl+E</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl+Delete</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl+R</kbd>). An accepted edit is written back to `config.toml` — only that action's `[keybindings]` entry, with the previous file copied to a timestamped `.bak` — so it survives a restart. The write runs on a background worker and the rebind takes effect as soon as it answers, so editing a shortcut never stalls drawing, and a chord the file has meanwhile given to another action is refused rather than applied and then taken back. Reset writes the shipped default out explicitly rather than removing the key, and when the action already resolves to that default — usually because the file omits it — there is nothing to write, so nothing is written and the toast says the action already uses the default shortcut. Conflicting shortcuts are rejected, naming the action that already owns the chord, and nothing is written; that includes a chord another action has been given in the file since this run started, which is refused rather than applied. If the file cannot be written the shortcut still changes for the run and the toast says the save failed. <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+E</kbd> on a palette row opens the same shortcut in the configurator's Keybindings screen.
- **Backend**: `backend` (or `WAYSCRIBER_TOOLBAR_BACKEND`) picks the toolbar frontend. `auto` uses the GTK4 top bar exactly where the built-in bars would own a separate layer surface (layer-shell present, no forced inline, no overlay-layer canvas) and falls back to the built-in Cairo top bar everywhere else, including at runtime if GTK fails to start. `gtk` warns when unsupported and then falls back; `builtin` always uses the Cairo bars.
- **Pinned**: `top_pinned` is the authored default for whether the top toolbar opens on startup. Pinning or unpinning in the overlay saves to `runtime-ui.toml` and leaves this value alone. The show/hide keybinding (`toggle_toolbar`, default <kbd>F9</kbd>) updates the remembered pin, so the next start matches what was on screen.
- **Minimize**: the toolbar minimize button collapses the top strip to a small edge tab instead of hiding it, so there is always an on-screen way back; `top_minimized` is the authored default, and the state you leave the bar in survives restarts as a runtime preference in `runtime-ui.toml`. F9 still toggles full visibility.
- **Micro mode**: `cycle_toolbar_display` (default <kbd>F2</kbd>) cycles the top strip full → micro → hidden. Micro collapses the strip to one 44px round chip showing the active tool inside a ring stroked in the current color (ring width follows stroke thickness); clicking the chip restores the full strip. The full/micro form persists as a runtime preference in `runtime-ui.toml`, seeded by the authored `top_display_mode`; the hidden step alone is runtime-only — the next start derives the strip's visibility from the remembered pin (which the F9 show/hide toggle updates durably), so a cycle-hidden strip comes back. Entering micro un-minimizes the strip; if a config sets both `top_minimized` and micro, the minimized restore tab wins.
- **Idle fade**: `idle_fade` dims the top-strip islands to 55% opacity after ~4 seconds without drawing activity and restores when the pointer approaches the toolbar (or on the next stroke). Open top-strip menus, the minimized tab, and the micro chip never fade. With `[ui] reduced_motion` the fade snaps instantly instead of animating. Set `idle_fade = false` (or uncheck **Idle fade** in the overlay Settings popover / **Dim toolbar when idle** in the configurator) to keep the bar fully visible.
- **Top-only toolbar**: the unified top toolbar is the only supported layout. Drawing properties live in the contextual style pill; canvas management lives in the **"Canvas…" overflow popover**, the **bottom-right zoom chip**, and the **status-bar board picker**; presets live in the **top-strip presets island**; Session and Settings live in overflow popovers. Older panel keys (`side_layout`, `side_pinned`, `side_minimized`, `side_active_pane`, `collapsed_sections`, `side_offset`, `side_offset_x`, `show_settings_section`, and the retired `items.order.*` lists `side_sections`, `actions`, `pages`, `boards`, `presets`, `tool_options`, and `sessions`) remain readable, are preserved on unrelated saves, and surface as retired-setting diagnostics so they can be removed manually.
- **Session/Settings popovers**: the top strip's overflow menu always carries "Session..." and "Settings..." entries. Opening one closes the other and the overflow menu; Escape and clicking away dismiss it. Content taller than the popover cap scrolls internally.
- **Hidden items**: `ui.toolbar.items.hidden` removes known toolbar buttons/sections from sizing, drawing, and hit testing while preserving unknown future IDs.
- **Shown items**: `ui.toolbar.items.shown` pins sections visible against the layout-mode baseline. Together with `hidden` these are the single visibility store: the `show_*` booleans are written as read-only mirrors for older versions, and legacy configs fold into explicit overrides at load.
- **Layout modes are non-destructive presets**: switching Simple/Regular/Advanced re-baselines section visibility without erasing your explicit toggles; Advanced is selectable from the overlay's Settings popover, and the top strip's chrome-island layout button cycles Simple → Regular → Advanced one click at a time. The section ids `side.group.actions-advanced`, `side.group.zoom-actions`, and `side.group.text-controls` carry the advanced/zoom/persistent-text overrides. Switching modes from the overlay re-baselines the current run only; set the durable `layout_mode` in the configurator. Sections you pinned through `items.shown`/`items.hidden` keep their override under every mode.
- **Item order**: `ui.toolbar.items.order.top_tools` and `top_controls` reorder supported top-strip items. Unknown future IDs and wrong-group IDs are ignored at runtime but preserved across saves. Panel-era order lists (`actions`, `pages`, `boards`, `presets`, `tool_options`, `sessions`, `side_sections`) are retired: authored `config.toml` values stay as retired settings, while matching keys under `runtime-ui.toml`'s recognized `item_order` map are pruned on rewrite.
- **Historical item IDs**: retained and removed `side.*` IDs are classified in the [toolbar item ID compatibility inventory](toolbar-item-id-compatibility.md). Retained spellings remain active configuration contracts even though the side palette is gone.
- **Live customization**: the overlay Customize surface supports show/hide, move up/down, and drag reorder for supported top groups. The configurator supports the same saved order with up/down controls.
- **Top strip items**: `top.group.quick-colors` (the swatch row + current-color chip) and `top.utility.undo`/`top.utility.redo` are hideable ids. `top.chrome.overflow` is a structural affordance that appears whenever its menu has content — which is always: the menu anchors Clear (`top.utility.clear-canvas`, unless that item is hidden), anything width pressure moves into it, and the non-hideable "Session..." / "Settings..." popover entries. The icon/text mode toggle lives in the Settings popover.
- **Clear canvas**: Clear lives in the top strip's overflow (⋯) menu. A plain click clears and shows a short "Cleared — Undo?" toast; Shift+click clears instantly without the toast. The `clear_canvas` keyboard action is always instant and shows no toast.
- **Recoloring a swatch**: right-clicking any quick-color swatch in the style pill opens the color picker bound to that palette slot, titled "Recolor &lt;slot&gt;". The swatch tracks the gradient live, OK applies the color to that slot and writes it back to `config.toml` — only that one `[[drawing.quick_colors]]` entry, with the previous file copied to a timestamped `.bak` — and Cancel/Escape restores it. Recoloring a slot the file only implies writes the palette out as far as that slot and no further, so the slots after it keep tracking the shipped defaults. If the file cannot be written the color still applies for the run and the toast says the save failed; picking the color the slot already paints writes nothing and says so. The slot keeps its label and shortcut, so R still selects the red slot after you point it at a different red. Recoloring the swatch you are currently drawing with moves the live color with it; recoloring any other slot leaves your current color alone. Left-clicking a swatch still just selects it, and the leftmost chip still opens the picker for the active tool's own color.
- **Restoring a swatch's shipped color**: while recoloring a slot, the picker adds a **Default** button next to OK/Cancel that loads the color wayscriber ships for that slot. It stages the color like any other pick — the swatch previews it, OK applies and saves it, Cancel backs out — so it is not a separate destructive action. The button only appears for the eleven built-in slots; extra slots you added past them have no shipped default, and the tool-color picker never shows it. Restoring sets the built-in value in your palette rather than deleting the entry, so the slot keeps its identity.
- **Shapes popover options**: the Fill checkbox (`top.utility.fill`) remains available in the Shapes popover whenever that item is enabled, even while another tool is active, so it can configure the next fill-capable shape. The polygon side count appears only while Regular Polygon is active. These controls live in the popover instead of a permanently reserved mini-checkbox lane under the bar, keeping the bar 58px tall. The highlight-ring row still appears under the Highlight button, but only while the highlight tool is active.
- **Screenshot toolbar button**: `top.utility.screenshot` is hidden by default; remove it from `ui.toolbar.items.hidden` or enable it in the configurator/overlay customization to show it.

**Defaults:** all set as above.

### `[boards]` - Boards (Backgrounds + Names)

Configure multiple boards (each with its own pages) plus the special transparent overlay.

```toml
[boards]
max_count = 9
auto_create = true
show_board_badge = true
pan_enabled = true
show_pan_badge = true
persist_customizations = true
default_board = "transparent"

[[boards.items]]
id = "transparent"
name = "Overlay"
background = "transparent"
persist = true

[[boards.items]]
id = "whiteboard"
name = "Whiteboard"
background = { rgb = [0.992, 0.992, 0.992] }
# Tuned black #241F31; the built-in default bit-matches the "black" quick color
default_pen_color = { rgb = [0.141, 0.122, 0.192] }
auto_adjust_pen = true

[[boards.items]]
id = "blackboard"
name = "Blackboard"
background = { rgb = [0.067, 0.067, 0.067] }
default_pen_color = { rgb = [1.0, 1.0, 1.0] }
auto_adjust_pen = true

[[boards.items]]
id = "blueprint"
name = "Blueprint"
background = { rgb = [0.063, 0.125, 0.251] }
default_pen_color = { rgb = [0.902, 0.945, 1.0] }

[[boards.items]]
id = "corkboard"
name = "Corkboard"
background = { rgb = [0.420, 0.294, 0.165] }
default_pen_color = { rgb = [0.969, 0.890, 0.784] }
```

**Fields:**
- `max_count` — hard cap on total boards.
- `auto_create` — create a board when switching to an empty slot.
- `show_board_badge` — show board name/slot in the status bar.
- `pan_enabled` — allow panning on solid-color boards with <kbd>Space</kbd> + left-drag.
- `show_pan_badge` — show the pan hint in the status bar or as a floating badge.
- `persist_customizations` — **deprecated no-op**, still parsed so existing files load without a
  warning. Board renames, recolors, additions, and deletions belong to the running session (and are
  saved with it when the board sets `persist`); the list below is the set of templates a new session
  starts from, edited in the configurator. The key is ignored whatever you set it to and will be
  removed in a future release.
- `default_board` — board id to activate on startup.
- `items` — ordered list of boards; each board has:
  - `id` — stable identifier (used by keybindings and persistence).
  - `name` — display name in the UI.
  - `background` — `"transparent"` or `{ rgb = [..] }`.
  - `default_pen_color` — optional; if omitted and `auto_adjust_pen = true`, pen color is auto-contrasted.
  - `auto_adjust_pen` — auto-switch pen color on entry.
  - `persist` — include this board in session saves.

**Keybindings:**
- <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+1..9</kbd>: Switch board slots
- <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+Left/Right</kbd>: Previous/next board
- <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+N</kbd>: New board
- <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+Delete</kbd>: Delete board
- <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+B</kbd>: Board picker (inline rename/color)
- Aliases (configurable): <kbd>Ctrl+W</kbd> = whiteboard, <kbd>Ctrl+B</kbd> = blackboard, <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+T</kbd> = transparent

**Board Picker:**
- Modal list for switching, renaming, and recoloring boards.
- Inline edits apply to the active session, not to the templates in `config.toml`. Edit the
  templates in the configurator's Boards screen.

**Solid-board pan:**
- Hold <kbd>Space</kbd> and drag with the left mouse button to pan whiteboards and other solid-color boards.
- Transparent overlay does not pan; it stays anchored to the live screen.
- The canvas context menu includes **Reset Canvas Position** when board panning is enabled.
- The same right-click menu exposes **Zoom** → **Zoom In**, **Zoom Out**, and **Reset Zoom**.
- Right-click menus expose **Paste**; shape menus also expose **Copy** for the selected annotations.
- Pan offsets are stored per page, so each page keeps its own position.

**CLI Override:**
Use a board id with `--mode`:
```bash
wayscriber --active --mode whiteboard
wayscriber --active --mode blueprint
wayscriber --daemon --mode transparent
```

### `[board]` - Legacy Board Modes

This section is still recognized for backward compatibility. If `[boards]` is missing,
wayscriber will synthesize boards from `[board]`. New configurations should prefer `[boards]`.

### `[render_profiles]` - Render Color Profiles

Render profiles preview an alternate final color mapping without changing saved shapes or board
data. They are useful for print, projectors, grayscale-ish previews, and light/dark sharing
workflows.

```toml
[render_profiles]
# Optional profile id to preview on startup
# active = "print"
apply_to_canvas = true
apply_to_ui = true
export = "off"
# export_profile = "print"

[[render_profiles.profiles]]
id = "print"
name = "Print"
mappings = [
  { from = "#000000", to = "#FFFFFF" },
  { from = "#FFFFFF", to = "#000000" },
  { from = "#FFFF00", to = "#8B4513" },
  { from = "#00FF00", to = "#006400" },
]
```

**Behavior:**
- `id` is the stable identifier used by `active` and runtime profile switching.
- Profile entries are stored under `profiles`.
- `apply_to_canvas` controls board backgrounds, annotations, and canvas-space editor previews such as selections, hover rings, provisional strokes, text-edit previews, and click highlights.
- `apply_to_ui` controls screen-space Wayscriber UI chrome, status text, popups, command palette, and toolbars.
- `export` controls explicit canvas PNG export remapping: `off`, `active`, or `profile`.
- `export_profile` is used only when `export = "profile"`.
- `mappings` use exact RGB matches. Accepted input forms are `#RRGGBB`, `RRGGBB`, and `0xRRGGBB`; validation normalizes to `#RRGGBB`.
- Pixel alpha is preserved. Unmapped colors are unchanged.
- With both targets enabled, profiles apply to Wayscriber-rendered pixels: annotations, board backgrounds, UI chrome, toolbars, popups, embedded images, and frozen/zoom backgrounds when Wayscriber paints them.
- Set `apply_to_ui = false` to preview remapped canvas content while keeping screen-space UI text and controls in the normal theme.
- Profiles do not recolor the compositor-owned live desktop seen through a transparent overlay.
- Explicit canvas PNG export applies its resolved export profile to persisted Wayscriber canvas content only, uses the current panned board viewport, respects output scale, and excludes frozen/zoom desktop pixels.
- Board PDF export writes the active board or every board to a file with one PDF page per Wayscriber page. PDF export preserves board/page order and solid board backgrounds, but does not apply export render profiles. A page with a magnified Spotlight is rasterized for correct pixel sampling; its optional PDF labels remain vector content drawn afterward.
- `[export.pdf]` controls PDF filename fallback, page size, orientation, fit mode, and optional page labels.
- Explicit canvas export and its clipboard-failure fallback save PNG data as `.png`; screenshot clipboard fallback still uses `[capture].format`.
- `[capture].enabled` disables compositor screenshot capture actions, not explicit export actions.
- Board PDF export is file-only; clipboard PDF export is not supported yet.

**Runtime actions:**
- `render_profile_next`
- `render_profile_previous`
- `render_profile_off`

**Canvas export actions:**
- `export_canvas_file`
- `export_canvas_clipboard`
- `export_canvas_clipboard_and_file`
- `export_board_pdf_file`
- `export_all_boards_pdf_file`

### `[capture]` - Screenshot Capture

Configures how screenshots are stored and shared.

```toml
[capture]
# Enable/disable capture shortcuts entirely
enabled = true

# Directory for saved screenshots (supports ~ expansion)
save_directory = "~/Pictures/Wayscriber"

**Tips:**
- Set `copy_to_clipboard = false` if you prefer file-only captures.
- Set `include_drawings = false` if full-screen and region captures should use
  raw desktop pixels by default.
- Clipboard-only shortcuts ignore the save directory automatically.
- Image clipboard delivery publishes PNG data with `wl-copy`, reads it back
  with `wl-paste`, and retries the complete write once unless the bytes match.
  Read-back is used for PNG payloads smaller than 64 MiB; larger successful
  `wl-copy` publications keep the previous status-only behavior.
- `filename_template` must be a single file name (no `/` or `..`). `format` is `png`, `jpg`, or `jpeg`.
- `wl-clipboard`, `grim`, and `slurp` are installed automatically by deb/rpm/AUR packages. For source/tarball installs, add them manually. Wayscriber uses its native region picker by default and falls back to `slurp` when it cannot obtain the desktop image; other screenshot capture paths can fall back to `xdg-desktop-portal`.

#### Region picker

Bound region screenshot actions use the native picker by default. It draws over
the active output's frozen desktop image, shows a crosshair and optional size
readout/legend, and sends the selected pixels to the shortcut's existing
clipboard or file destination. If no screen capture backend is available, it
falls back to `slurp`.

On Hyprland and Sway, the native picker also discovers visible windows on the
active output and workspace. Press `Space` to switch between free-area and
window selection, point at a window and click it, or move between candidates
with `Super+Arrow` and choose with `Enter`. Press `Space` again to return to
area selection. Window controls stay hidden when the compositor is unsupported,
the geometry helper fails, or no selectable windows are available. The
external `slurp` picker does not provide this mode.
Window mode is also hidden when the picker reuses a pre-existing Freeze or Zoom
image. Wayscriber currently offers it only for the fresh auto-freeze created by
the picker. It checks the provider result against that source's output and
layout identity before showing candidates; a mismatch leaves window mode
unavailable. At fractional scales, Wayland and Hyprland can round the same
logical output size one pixel differently. That one-pixel size difference is
accepted, but candidate bounds are restricted to the overlap; larger size
differences or any origin change disable window mode.
Wayland has no portable workspace identity at the freeze boundary, so window
candidates reflect the workspace visible when the compositor query runs. A
workspace switch in the short freeze-to-query interval can therefore make
window mode describe the new workspace while the frozen image still shows the
old one; returning to area mode remains safe.

`capture_region_interactive` opens the same picker, then keeps the selection in
a review step where you can copy it, save it, do both, or add it to the active
board. It owns <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+C</kbd> by default, and is also in the command
palette. That chord previously ran `capture_clipboard_selection`, which now
ships unbound: Review's **Copy** (<kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd>) reaches the same clipboard
result, so bind `capture_clipboard_selection` explicitly if you want the
one-step copy back. The interactive action
always uses the native picker even when `picker = "slurp"`; if native capture
is unavailable it reports that limitation instead of silently skipping Review.
The **Both** button (and `Enter`) always copies the PNG and saves it to a file,
independently of `[capture].copy_to_clipboard`; it is the accented default in
the Review bar for that reason.

Review drops the targeting chrome once the rectangle is committed. The
crosshair disappears, the size badge parks on the selection's corner instead of
trailing the pointer — moving inside the rectangle when the action bar or a
screen edge needs that space — and the cursor stops being a crosshair: a hand
over an action-bar button, a grab hand over the rectangle you can still drag,
and an arrow everywhere else.

Adjust the rectangle before you send it. Drag its interior to move it, or the
arrow keys to nudge it one pixel at a time (`Shift` makes that ten). Eight
resize grips sit on the rectangle: drag a corner to move two edges at once, or
an edge midpoint to move one. A grip dragged past the opposite edge stops
rather than flipping the rectangle, and one dragged off the screen stops at the
edge of the captured image. Short sides drop their midpoint grip so it cannot
crowd the corners, and a small rectangle scales its grips down so its middle
always stays draggable; corners are always offered. Pressing outside the
rectangle starts a new selection instead.

`[capture].include_drawings` defaults to `true`, so full-screen and region
screenshots include the active board's committed shapes. Provisional strokes,
selection handles, tool previews, toolbars, and other Wayscriber UI are not
included. Set it to `false` for raw desktop pixels by default. On a transparent
board, full-screen and legacy `slurp` capture keep the desktop behind the
annotations; a solid board keeps its canvas background. The native region
picker instead composites committed drawings over the frozen desktop crop.
Those committed drawings are visible inside the native picker itself, so the
selection preview matches the annotated export. Provisional strokes, selection
handles, tool previews, toolbars, and other transient UI remain hidden.

The Review bar's **Include drawings in exports** toggle (or `D`) starts from
that configured default and can override it for one interactive region capture.
Copy, Save, Both, and Board all honour the current toggle. Note that adding an
annotated crop to the board it was composited from bakes a second, flattened
copy of those annotations into the image, sitting over the live shapes until
you move the pasted image. A pasted image occupies whole board pixels, so the
baked copy normally sits within half a board pixel of the live shapes. A crop
under a board pixel across — a few source pixels at any output scale above 1x —
can have both its edges round onto the same board pixel, depending on where it
falls; it then takes the whole board pixel centred on it, and its edges can sit
up to a pixel out. Turn the toggle off before pressing **Board** when you want
the raw crop instead.

`measure_mode` opens a capture-free screen ruler over the live Wayscriber
view. Drag to measure a rectangle in logical screen pixels; the completed
rectangle stays visible so you can read it, and another drag replaces it.
`Esc`, right-click, or invoking **Measure Mode** again exits. It does not
reserve capture state, freeze the desktop, encode an image, or deliver a file
or clipboard payload. The action is available from the command palette and is
unbound by default.

- Set `picker = "slurp"` to always use the external selector. This is also the
  option for selecting a region on a monitor other than Wayscriber's active
  output.
- `show_size_readout` shows pointer coordinates before the drag and the
  selected width and height in exported image pixels during it. In Review the
  same readout is anchored to the selection instead of the pointer.
- `show_legend` shows the short hotkey guide until the first drag.
- `show_loupe` shows a magnified pixel grid beside the pointer while dragging
  or reviewing a selection.
- Native region screenshot actions encode PNG and use a `.png` filename even
  when `[capture].format` is `jpg` or `jpeg`; this prevents PNG bytes from being
  written under a JPEG extension. An explicit `picker = "slurp"` keeps the
  configured format used by the legacy `slurp`/`grim` path.
- A configuration reload affects the next region selection; it does not change
  a picker that is already open.

#### Copy text from screen (OCR)

`Copy text from screen` selects a region of the desktop image wayscriber is
already showing, recognizes the text in it with a local Tesseract, and copies
the result to the clipboard. It reads the underlying screen capture only —
never your annotations, the toolbars, or any other wayscriber chrome — and it
does not change the active tool, the drawing history, or the board.

- The action is `copy_text_from_screen`, bound to <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+X</kbd>
  ("extract text"). `O` belongs to the orange quick color, so it takes a letter
  the rest of the capture family had left; rebind it in the configurator or in
  `[keybindings.capture]`.
- It is also in the command palette (search for "OCR"), and as an optional top
  toolbar button (`top.utility.ocr`), hidden by default like Screenshot.
- `ocr_languages` accepts one language or several joined with `+`
  (`eng`, `eng+deu`). Only letters, digits, `_` and `-` are accepted; anything
  else falls back to `eng`.
- OCR obeys `enabled` above: with capture disabled, the action reports that and
  does nothing.
- On a solid whiteboard or blackboard with no visible screen capture, OCR
  refuses rather than reading the board.
- <kbd>Ctrl+A</kbd> reads the whole displayed image, so a full screen of text
  does not need a drag across the whole output. The selector says so along the
  top until your first drag, the same hint strip the region picker uses and
  under the same `[capture.region] show_legend` setting.
- While recognition runs, a band sweeps the region being read. When it finishes,
  a short card beside the region says what happened — copied and how many
  characters, no text found, or that recognition failed — and fades after a few
  seconds. Any click, touch, stylus press or key dismisses the card early; a
  sweep still waiting on the recognizer is left alone, so a stray keystroke
  cannot discard a result that is about to arrive. The card never shows the
  recognized text: Wayscriber keeps screen contents out of its own UI, and the
  text goes only to the clipboard. With `[ui] reduced_motion` set, the region is
  marked with a static tint instead of a moving band and the card appears as
  soon as the result does.
- An active OCR selection cancels if the displayed screen image changes, the
  zoom level or pan changes, or freeze, output, scale, or display layout state
  is replaced.

**Requirements:** the `tesseract` command plus the language data for every code
in `ocr_languages`, and `wl-copy` (from `wl-clipboard`) for the clipboard write.

| Distribution | Packages |
| --- | --- |
| Arch / Omarchy | `tesseract`, `tesseract-data-eng` |
| Debian / Ubuntu | `tesseract-ocr` (depends on the English data) |
| Fedora | `tesseract`, `tesseract-langpack-eng` |
| Nix | the `tesseract` package/wrapper with `eng` enabled |
- Use `--exit-after-capture` / `--no-exit-after-capture` to override exit behavior per run.

### `[export.pdf]` - PDF Export

Configures explicit PDF exports. If `filename_template` is omitted or blank, active-board PDF
exports reuse `[capture].filename_template` and save with a `.pdf` extension. All-board PDF exports
use `all_boards_filename_template`, then `filename_template`, then `[capture].filename_template`.

```toml
[export.pdf]
# filename_template = "board_%Y-%m-%d_%H%M%S"
# all_boards_filename_template = "boards_%Y-%m-%d_%H%M%S"
page_size = "viewport"       # viewport, a4, letter, custom
orientation = "auto"         # auto, portrait, landscape
fit = "viewport"             # viewport, fit-viewport-to-page, fit-content-to-page
transparent_background = "none" # none, desktop
custom_width = 800.0         # PDF points, used with page_size = "custom"
custom_height = 600.0
content_source_padding = 24.0 # source units, used with fit-content-to-page

[export.pdf.labels]
enabled = false
position = "bottom-center"   # top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right, bottom-center
content = "custom-template"  # custom-template, board-and-page, document-page, board-name, page-name
template = "{board_name} - {page_name} ({document_page}/{document_pages})"
font_family = "Sans"
font_size = 10.0
margin = 12.0
padding_x = 6.0
padding_y = 3.0
text_color = [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 1.0]
background_enabled = true
background_color = [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.85]
```

`fit = "viewport"` draws the viewport 1:1 without scaling. With the default
`page_size = "viewport"`, this preserves the legacy export. `fit-viewport-to-page` scales the
viewport into the configured page size. `fit-content-to-page` scales the page's padded annotation
bounds into the configured page size, falling back to the viewport for blank pages.

`transparent_background = "desktop"` is opt-in. It hides the overlay, captures the live desktop
visible on the active output, and uses that image behind transparent PDF pages. Solid boards keep
their configured background. If the desktop capture is denied or the active output cannot be
isolated, the PDF export fails and no file is saved.

Label templates support `{app_board}`, `{app_boards}`, `{export_board}`, `{export_boards}`,
`{page}`, `{pages}`, `{document_page}`, `{document_pages}`, `{board_name}`, and `{page_name}`.
Use `{{` and `}}` for literal braces. `content = "custom-template"` uses `template`; the other
content modes ignore it. Labels are drawn after canvas content, ellipsized to one line, and omitted
if the page is too small.

### `[tablet]` - Tablet/Stylus Input

Runtime toggles for tablet/stylus input (Wayland `zwp_tablet_v2`).

```toml
[tablet]
enabled = true
pressure_enabled = true
min_thickness = 1.0
max_thickness = 8.0
auto_eraser_switch = true
pressure_variation_threshold = 0.1
pressure_thickness_edit_mode = "disabled"
pressure_thickness_entry_mode = "pressure_only"
pressure_thickness_scale_step = 0.1

[tablet.stylus_button]
action = "toggle_radial_menu"

[tablet.stylus_button2]
# action = "undo"
```

**Notes:**
- Requires the `tablet-input` feature at build time (enabled in default release builds).
- Tablet input is enabled by default when the feature is compiled in; set `enabled = false` to opt out.
- Pressure-to-thickness mapping applies only to pressure-sensitive freehand Pen strokes. Marker/Textmarker, Step Marker, and shape tools keep their selected sizes when used with a stylus.
- `stylus_button` is the primary barrel button (`BTN_STYLUS` / 331); `stylus_button2` is the secondary barrel button (`BTN_STYLUS2` / 332).
- Barrel button `action` values use normal action names, such as `toggle_radial_menu`, `undo`, and `redo`. Omit `action` to leave a button unbound.
- These nodes are a compatibility source. Prefer `StylusPrimary` / `StylusSecondary` in `[keybindings]`. The configurator can move a legacy assignment into the keybinding list; loading alone never deletes the tablet nodes.

### `[session]` - Session Persistence

Optional on-disk persistence for your drawings. Enabled by default so sessions resume automatically.

```toml
[session]
persist_transparent = true
persist_whiteboard = true
persist_blackboard = true
persist_history = true
restore_tool_state = true
storage = "auto"
# custom_directory = "/absolute/path"
per_output = true
max_shapes_per_frame = 10000
max_file_size_mb = 50
compress = "auto"
auto_compress_threshold_kb = 100
backup_retention = 1
# max_persisted_undo_depth = 200
```

- `persist_*` — choose which boards survive restarts (`persist_transparent` for overlay, `persist_whiteboard`/`persist_blackboard` gate non-transparent boards for legacy compatibility)
- `persist_history` — when `true`, persist undo/redo stacks so that history survives restarts; set to `false` to save only visible drawings
- `restore_tool_state` — save pen colour, thickness, font size, arrow settings (including head placement), and the starting Spotlight magnification; when `true`, the last-used tool state overrides config defaults at startup. Chrome is not tool state: status bar and badge visibility come from `[ui]` on every start, and an overlay toggle of them applies to that run only. Sessions written by older releases still carry a `show_status_bar` value; it is ignored on load and no longer written
- `storage` — `auto` (XDG data dir, e.g. `~/.local/share/wayscriber`), `config` (same directory as `config.toml`), or `custom`
- `custom_directory` — absolute path used when `storage = "custom"`; supports `~`
- `per_output` — when `true` (default) keep a separate session file for each monitor; set to `false` to share one file per Wayland display as in earlier releases
- `max_shapes_per_frame` — trims older shapes if a frame grows beyond this count when loading/saving
- `max_file_size_mb` — skips loading and writing session files beyond this size cap; image paste and autosave warn near the cap
- `compress` — `auto` (gzip files above the threshold), `on`, or `off`
- `auto_compress_threshold_kb` — size threshold for `compress = "auto"`
- `backup_retention` — how many rotated `.bak` files to keep (set to 0 to disable backups)
- `max_persisted_undo_depth` — optional cap for serialized history; default follows the runtime undo limit (set `persist_history = false` to skip history entirely)

> **Privacy note:** Session files are stored unencrypted. Clear the session directory or disable persistence when working with sensitive material.

The tray menu's **Session persistence settings…** entry opens the configurator on this section
rather than toggling the flags itself; the daemon reads `[session]` to draw its menu and never
writes it. For a single run, use `--resume-session` / `--no-resume-session` or
`WAYSCRIBER_RESUME_SESSION` instead.

Use the CLI helpers for quick maintenance:

- `wayscriber --session-info` prints the active storage path, file details, and shape counts.
- `wayscriber --clear-session` removes the session file, backup, and lock.
- `wayscriber --clear-tool-state` removes only the saved tool defaults from the session snapshot, preserving saved boards and history.
- `wayscriber --active --session-file ~/Documents/lecture-04.wayscriber-session` opens and saves a named session file directly.
- `wayscriber --freeze --session-file ~/Documents/lecture-04.wayscriber-session` starts frozen mode with that same named session target.
- `wayscriber --daemon --session-file ~/Documents/lecture-04.wayscriber-session` starts a daemon whose overlay activations use that named session target.
- `wayscriber --daemon-toggle --session-file ~/Documents/meeting.wayscriber-session` asks the running daemon to launch a hidden overlay with that named session target. If the overlay is already visible with a different target, hide it before switching.
- `wayscriber --session-info --session-file <path>`, `wayscriber --clear-session --session-file <path>`, and `wayscriber --clear-tool-state --session-file <path>` target only that named file.

Config values seed startup defaults. When `restore_tool_state = true`, the saved session tool state is applied after those defaults, so edits such as `[arrow] head_at_end = true` can appear ignored if the session snapshot still stores an older arrow setting. Run `wayscriber --clear-tool-state` (or add `--session-file <path>` for a named session) to make config defaults apply on the next startup without deleting saved boards. In a running overlay, Command Palette -> Reset Tool Defaults clears the saved layer for the active session and immediately applies config defaults to the current tools so the next autosave keeps those defaults.

The configurator Session tab exposes the same distinction for recent named sessions: Clear Tool State preserves saved boards/history while removing only persisted tool settings; Clear Saved Data removes saved session files. Offline catalog actions are disabled while an overlay, manually started daemon, or background service is active. Use the command palette for the active overlay session.

The overlay Session panel lives in the top strip's overflow **"Session..."** popover:

- `Open` loads an existing named session, saves dirty current data first when needed, and records the target in the recent catalog.
- `Save As` writes the current overlay to another named session and switches the active target. It appends `.wayscriber-session` when no extension is supplied and asks before replacing existing session artifacts.
- `Info` reports the active session file size, board shape counts, and history status.
- `Clear` writes a durable empty session boundary for the active target.
- Recent session rows reopen other named sessions. If a recent target is missing, Wayscriber removes that stale catalog entry after the failed open.
- `Manager` opens the configurator. Overlay Open/Save As dialogs use `zenity` or `kdialog`.

The configurator Session tab also shows recent named sessions from the catalog, recorded when named-session targets are opened or saved from the CLI, daemon, or overlay. It can rename catalog display labels, reveal file locations, and forget catalog metadata without touching files. Duplicate, Move, and Clear are disabled while an overlay, manually started daemon, or background service is active.

Session overrides and recovery:

- CLI flags: `--resume-session` forces persistence on, `--no-resume-session` forces it off for the current run. The environment variable `WAYSCRIBER_RESUME_SESSION=1/0` does the same.
- `--session-file` implies session persistence for that overlay run and conflicts with `--no-resume-session`. Named sessions use the exact selected file path; Wayscriber does not create missing parent directories or fall back to configured storage. Foreground/open targets reject directories, symlinks, and special files.
- Size fallback: if visible drawings fit but persisted undo/redo history would exceed save or restore safety limits, autosave saves the drawings and warns once per run that history was trimmed or omitted.
- Image paste guard: when a pasted image would push visible session data over `max_file_size_mb`, Wayscriber blocks the paste and points you to `[session] max_file_size_mb`; when only undo history is at risk, the paste is allowed with a warning.
- Load safety: compressed session files are checked against an internal expanded-size cap while saving and loading. If an existing file expands beyond that cap, wayscriber refuses to load it, leaves the primary session file unchanged, and avoids overwriting it until session data changes.
- Recovery: if a session file is corrupt or cannot be parsed/decompressed, wayscriber logs a warning, writes a `.bak` copy of the bad file, removes the corrupt file, and continues with defaults. Overrides above still apply after recovery.

For end-to-end CLI, overlay, and configurator flows, see [`examples/session-manager.md`](../examples/session-manager.md).

### `[keybindings]` - Custom Keybindings

Customize keyboard shortcuts for all actions. Each action can have multiple keybindings.
For multi-monitor, customize `focus_prev_output` and `focus_next_output` in this section.

A shortcut is a key name, auxiliary mouse button, or stylus barrel button with optional
modifiers joined by `+`. The modifiers are `Ctrl` (`Control`), `Shift`, `Alt`, and `Super`
(`Meta`, `Logo`, `Win`, `Windows`). Matching, conflicts, and display use the canonical
spelling `Super`. Examples: `Escape`, `Ctrl+Z`, `Super+X`, `Ctrl+Shift+T`, `F10`,
`MouseBack`, `Ctrl+MouseForward`, `StylusPrimary`, `Ctrl+K > Ctrl+C`. Super chords work when
the compositor delivers them; if the desktop consumes Super before Wayscriber or the
configurator sees it, type the shortcut with Edit as Text.

Two or three keyboard chords can be chained with `>` (`Ctrl+K > Ctrl+C`). Help and the
configurator show that as `Ctrl+K then Ctrl+C`. A comma still separates independent
shortcuts on one action. A standalone chord cannot also be a prefix of a sequence; two
sequences may share a first chord and diverge later. After a prefix, Wayscriber waits up
to one second for the next step.

Auxiliary mouse buttons `MouseBack`, `MouseForward`, and `MouseExtra1` through `MouseExtra4`
can be bound to actions. Left, middle, and right cannot: they already own drawing and
toolbar input. Stylus barrel buttons use `StylusPrimary` and `StylusSecondary`. Those names
can be recorded in the configurator when the device is identifiable; otherwise type them
with Edit as Text. Existing `[tablet.stylus_button]` / `[tablet.stylus_button2]` assignments
keep working until you move them into the keybinding list with **Move Legacy Binding**.

#### How a shortcut you did not write is decided

A `[keybindings]` field your file spells out is yours: it is used exactly as authored, including an
explicit empty list, which means "unbound". A field your file omits is filled in from this build's
defaults, but only where the key is still free — if the default's key is already claimed by
something you did bind, the default stands down and the action starts without it. Wayscriber says so
at startup and in the configurator — "X is a default shortcut for Y, but your configuration binds X
to Z; the default stays inactive and nothing was changed" — and the file is not changed either way.
That is why adding a shortcut to a new release can never quietly take over one of yours.

Two shortcuts you both authored on the same key are a conflict, not a stand-down: the first in
traversal order keeps the key, the other loses it for the session, and the diagnostic names both so
you can fix the file. Invalid shortcut text is reported and ignored for the session; its text stays
on disk untouched.

#### Reviewing an older `config_revision`

`config_revision` records which generation of shipped defaults a file was written against. Loading
never advances it and never rewrites the file. Instead, opening the configurator with an older
revision shows a **Configuration update available** banner listing every proposed shortcut change as
before → after. **Apply Update** changes the configurator draft only; nothing reaches disk until you
press Save, which writes the reviewed changes together with the new revision. A proposed field you
edited in the draft yourself since the file loaded is kept as you typed it rather than overwritten,
and the status says which ones it kept. Apply records the proposed revision even when your own edits
cover every field: the revision says you reviewed this generation, not that every shipped default
was copied verbatim, and it still reaches disk only when you press Save.
**Dismiss** hides the offer for the rest of that configurator run, including across Reload — unless
a reload lands on a different file, as it does when `config.toml` is a symlink you retarget at
another profile, in which case that file's offer is shown. Saving an unrelated setting without
applying leaves both your old bindings and your old `config_revision` on disk.

The revisions so far: revision 1 split the command-palette and full-screen-capture defaults
(`Ctrl+K` / `Ctrl+Shift+P` for the palette, `Ctrl+Alt+F` for capture); revision 2 moved `F2` out of
`toggle_toolbar` into the new `cycle_toolbar_display`; revision 3 gave `toggle_input_hud` its
`Ctrl+Shift+K` default. Customized fields are preserved by every recipe — a proposal only ever
targets a field you left at the value the older generation shipped.

Applying a revision proposal is optional. Presence-aware resolution already keeps new defaults out
of the way of anything you bound, so an old revision is safe to leave alone indefinitely; applying
one is a tidy-up that records your decision in the file.

**Contributing:** changing or adding a default keybinding no longer requires a
`CURRENT_CONFIG_REVISION` bump. A default is only ever offered to an action a configuration omits,
and only where the key is free, so a new or moved default cannot land on a shortcut a user bound to
something else (#293, #315); the skipped-default diagnostic reports the stand-down instead.
That informational notice is acknowledged in the profile's
`$XDG_DATA_HOME/wayscriber/onboarding.toml` state and appears once for each exact set of skipped
bindings; a later, different skipped default can notify once again. Actual
parse errors, invalid bindings, and conflicts continue to report on every start until they are fixed.
For the historical toolbar pair, either accept the revision-2 proposal (`F9` toggles the unified top
toolbar and `F2` cycles full → micro → hidden) or explicitly write
`cycle_toolbar_display = []` to keep `F2`/`F9` on `toggle_toolbar` without another notice.
What is still required: the new default must not collide with another shipped default
(`default_keybindings_have_no_conflicts` guards that), and
`default_bindings_match_the_checked_in_snapshot` holds a snapshot of every shipped default and fails
until the snapshot records the change deliberately. Bumping `CURRENT_CONFIG_REVISION`
(`src/config/core.rs`) plus a recipe in `Config::apply_keybinding_migrations`
(`src/config/validate/keybindings.rs`) remains available and optional, for when an old default is
worth proactively cleaning out of existing files through the configurator's review flow.

**Keybinding Format:**

Keybindings are specified as strings with modifiers and a key or device button separated by `+`:
- Simple keys: `"E"`, `"T"`, `"Escape"`, `"F10"`
- With modifiers: `"Ctrl+Z"`, `"Shift+T"`, `"Ctrl+Shift+W"`, `"Super+X"`
- Auxiliary mouse buttons: `"MouseBack"`, `"MouseForward"`, `"MouseExtra1"` through `"MouseExtra4"`
- Stylus barrel buttons: `"StylusPrimary"`, `"StylusSecondary"`
- Keyboard sequences (two or three chords): `"Ctrl+K > Ctrl+C"`. Help and the configurator show this as `Ctrl+K then Ctrl+C`.
- Special keys: `"Escape"`, `"Return"`, `"Backspace"`, `"Space"`, `"F10"`, `"F11"`, `"Home"`, `"End"`, `"PageUp"`, `"PageDown"`, `"ArrowUp"`, `"ArrowDown"`, `"ArrowLeft"`, `"ArrowRight"`, `"+"`, `"-"`, `"="`, `"_"`

Left, middle, and right mouse buttons cannot be bound as generic actions. Pointer and stylus buttons cannot appear as sequence steps.

A comma still separates independent shortcuts on one action (`F5, Ctrl+K > Ctrl+C`). Spaces around `>` are optional in the file and canonicalized to spaced `>` when that binding is rewritten.

A standalone chord cannot also be a prefix of a configured sequence (`Ctrl+K` and `Ctrl+K > Ctrl+C` cannot coexist). Two sequences may share a first chord and diverge later (`Ctrl+K > Ctrl+C` and `Ctrl+K > Ctrl+X`). After a prefix is pressed, Wayscriber waits up to one second for the next step; focus loss, overlay exit, a modal, a keymap reload, or a mismatch cancels the pending sequence. Key repeat does not advance a sequence.

**Supported Modifiers:**
- `Ctrl` (or `Control`)
- `Shift`
- `Alt`
- `Super` (or `Meta`, `Logo`, `Win`, `Windows`)

**Modifier Order:**
Modifiers can appear in any order - `"Ctrl+Shift+W"`, `"Shift+Ctrl+W"`, and `"Shift+W+Ctrl"` are all equivalent.

**Multiple Bindings:**
Each action supports multiple keybindings (e.g., both `+` and `=` for increase thickness).

**Duplicate Detection:**
Duplicate keybindings are detected at startup and resolved one key at a time — the rest of both actions' shortcuts always keep working, and your config file is never rewritten. When two actions claim the same combination, the contested key is removed from one of them for that session:

- A binding you customized always beats one that still equals its built-in default. Most collisions are of this kind: a shortcut you never wrote gets filled in from the shipped defaults and lands on a key you assigned to something else.
- If both sides are customized, the earlier action in the internal keymap order (core, selection, tools, board, ui, colors, capture, zoom, presets) keeps the key.

Every resolution is reported: a warning toast and a desktop notification name the key and both actions at startup, the configurator shows them after loading or saving, and the details are written to the log. Because nothing is written back, edit `config.toml` to decide which action should own the shortcut permanently.

**Case Insensitive:**
Key names are case-insensitive in the config file, but will match the actual key case at runtime.

**Examples:**

Vim-style navigation keys:
```toml
[keybindings]
exit = ["Escape", "Q"]
clear_canvas = ["D"]
undo = ["U"]
```

Emacs-style modifiers:
```toml
[keybindings]
exit = ["Ctrl+G"]
undo = ["Ctrl+/"]
clear_canvas = ["Ctrl+K"]
```

Gaming-friendly (WASD area):
```toml
[keybindings]
exit = ["Q"]
toggle_help = ["H"]
undo = ["Z"]
clear_canvas = ["X"]
```

**Notes:**
- Modifiers (<kbd>Shift</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, <kbd>Alt</kbd>, <kbd>Tab</kbd>) are always captured for drawing tools
- In text input mode, configured keybindings (like <kbd>Ctrl+Q</kbd> for exit) work before keys are consumed as text
- Color keys only work when not holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> (to avoid conflicts with other actions)
- Keybinding strings that cannot be parsed are detected at startup, reported, and dropped one string at a time for the running session; every other shortcut keeps working and the config file keeps the typo for you to fix
- Duplicate keybindings across actions are detected at startup, reported, and resolved per key without touching the config file

**Defaults:**
Defaults match the original hardcoded keybindings where possible. Copy/paste selection uses
<kbd>Ctrl+Alt+C</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl+Alt+V</kbd>, so the region capture shortcut uses
<kbd>Ctrl+Shift+C</kbd> to avoid conflicts. That chord now runs
`capture_region_interactive`; `capture_clipboard_selection` ships unbound. The paste action
also accepts PNG/JPEG image data and local image files copied from a file manager.

## Creating Your Configuration

1. Create the directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config/wayscriber
   ```

2. Copy the example config:
   ```bash
   cp config.example.toml ~/.config/wayscriber/config.toml
   ```

3. Edit to your preferences:
   ```bash
   nano ~/.config/wayscriber/config.toml
   ```

## Configuration Priority

Settings are loaded in this order:
1. Built-in defaults (hardcoded)
2. Configuration file values (override defaults)
3. Runtime changes made while Wayscriber is running (temporary, not saved)

Most of step 3 never reaches `config.toml`. Incidental preference toggles in the overlay—layout
mode, section and status bar visibility, icon mode, click highlight, the input HUD—change the
current run and reset on the next start; each one points at the configurator screen that owns its
configured default. Board work is not one of those. Renaming, recoloring, adding, or deleting a
board changes the session: it marks the session dirty, rides the session autosave, and comes back
on the next start for boards marked `persist`. Pinning a board goes to `runtime-ui.toml`. What
`[boards]` in `config.toml` holds is the set of boards a *new* session starts from, and only the
configurator edits that. The tray's session entry opens the configurator rather than editing the
file. Three deliberate editors are the exception: shortcut edit/unbind/reset,
preset save/clear, and quick-color recoloring each write their own key, on a background worker and
in the order you make them. Every write — theirs and a configurator Save — rewrites only the
settings you changed, without reformatting unrelated settings or removing user comments, and leaves
a timestamped `.bak`. Writers take an advisory lock on a `config.toml.lock` file beside the config
while they work, so the configurator and the overlay editing at the same moment cannot overwrite
one another's change.

Direct overlay manipulation—toolbar drags, pin/minimize, the display-form cycle, pane and section
collapse, individual item visibility and order, and board pins—goes to `runtime-ui.toml` and
survives a restart; see
[Configured defaults and runtime UI preferences](#configured-defaults-and-runtime-ui-preferences)
for the full table.

**Note:** Changes to the config file require restarting wayscriber daemon to take effect.

To reload config changes:
```bash
# Use the reload script
./reload-daemon.sh

# Or manually
pkill wayscriber
wayscriber --daemon &
```

## Environment Variables

These override behavior at runtime. Bool-ish values treat anything except `0`, `false`, or `off` as true.

- `WAYSCRIBER_NO_TRAY=1` disables the tray icon (default: tray enabled)
- `WAYSCRIBER_RESUME_SESSION=1/0` forces session persistence on/off for the current run (default: unset; follows config)
- `WAYSCRIBER_CONFIGURATOR=/path/to/wayscriber-configurator` overrides the configurator executable path
- `WAYSCRIBER_DISABLE_UPDATE_CHECK=1` disables the background update check for this run (overrides `[updates] check`; `--check-update` still works)
- `WAYSCRIBER_FORCE_INLINE_TOOLBARS=1` forces inline toolbars on Wayland (default: off)
- `WAYSCRIBER_TOOLBAR_DRAG_PREVIEW=0` disables inline toolbar drag preview (default: on)
- `WAYSCRIBER_TOOLBAR_POINTER_LOCK=1` enables pointer-lock drag path (experimental; default: on)
- `WAYSCRIBER_TOOLBAR_DRAG_THROTTLE_MS=12` throttles toolbar drag updates (default: 12; set 0 to disable)
- `WAYSCRIBER_DEBUG_TOOLBAR_DRAG=1` enables toolbar drag logging (default: off)
- `WAYSCRIBER_DEBUG_TOOLBAR_COLOR=1` enables toolbar color picker logging (default: off)
- `WAYSCRIBER_DEBUG_DAMAGE=1` enables damage region logging (default: off)
- `WAYSCRIBER_XDG_OUTPUT=...` forces GNOME fallback overlays onto a specific output (overrides `ui.preferred_output`)
- `WAYSCRIBER_XDG_FULLSCREEN=1` requests fullscreen GNOME fallback overlays (overrides `ui.xdg_fullscreen`)
- `WAYSCRIBER_XDG_FULLSCREEN_FORCE=1` bypasses the GNOME opacity safety check
- `RUST_LOG=info` enables Rust logging (default: unset; use `wayscriber=debug` for app-level logs)

## Troubleshooting

### Config File Not Loading

If your config file isn't being read:

1. Check the file path:
   ```bash
   ls -la ~/.config/wayscriber/config.toml
   ```

2. Verify TOML syntax:
   ```bash
   # Install a TOML validator if needed
   toml-validator ~/.config/wayscriber/config.toml
   ```

3. Check logs for errors:
   ```bash
   RUST_LOG=info wayscriber --active
   ```

### Invalid Values

If you specify invalid values:
- **Out of range**: Values will be clamped to valid ranges
- **Invalid color name**: Falls back to default (red)
- **Malformed RGB**: Falls back to default color
- **Parse errors**: Entire config file ignored, defaults used

Check the application logs for warnings about config issues.

## Advanced Usage

### Per-Project Configs

While wayscriber uses a single global config, you can:
1. Create different config files
2. Symlink the active one to `~/.config/wayscriber/config.toml`

Example:
```bash
# Create project-specific configs
cp config.example.toml ~/configs/wayscriber-presentation.toml
cp config.example.toml ~/configs/wayscriber-recording.toml

# Switch configs
ln -sf ~/configs/wayscriber-presentation.toml ~/.config/wayscriber/config.toml
```

### Configuration Examples

**High-contrast presentation mode:**
```toml
[drawing]
default_color = "yellow"
default_thickness = 5.0
default_font_size = 48.0

[ui]
status_bar_position = "top-right"
```

**Screen recording mode (subtle annotations):**
```toml
[drawing]
default_color = "blue"
default_thickness = 2.0
default_font_size = 24.0

[performance]
buffer_count = 4
enable_vsync = false
max_fps_no_vsync = 120
ui_animation_fps = 30

[ui]
show_status_bar = false
```

**Teaching/presentation mode (start in whiteboard):**
```toml
[boards]
default_board = "whiteboard"

[drawing]
default_thickness = 4.0
default_font_size = 42.0

[ui]
status_bar_position = "top-right"
```

**High-refresh display optimization:**
```toml
[performance]
buffer_count = 4
enable_vsync = false
max_fps_no_vsync = 144
ui_animation_fps = 120
```
